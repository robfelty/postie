 -= History =-
Below is all the of the version information. As far as I can tell there once was a guy named John Blade. He took some of the orignal wp-mail.php code and started hacking away on it. He actually got pretty far. About the time I discovered WordPress and his little hack - called WP-Mail at the time - he went on a vacation or something. There were some problems with the script, and it was missing some features I wanted. I hacked away at it and got it into a place where it did what I wanted. I started posting about it since I figured other people might want the features. 

John didn't release any more versions at least up til July 2005. So I started accepting submissions and feature requests from people to help make the code better. In June/July 2005 I discovered a little plugin by Chris J Davis (http://www.chrisjdavis.org/cjd-notepad/) called notepad. I added a small feature to it (basically a bookmarklet).  In the process I started looking at his code and realized how much you could do with the plugin system available in Word Press.

So I decided to make an offical fork. I put up an article on my blog asking for new names. I picked Postie.  I then modified the code to be a proper plugin.  And the rest is history :)
